A Python package designed to manage data from powder XRD experiments. The sole open-source Github project that is known to be developing a Rietveld refining method. 
In a nutshell, powerxrd is an open-source Python package for XRD data analysis. While Origin may still be preferred for more complex XRD analysis, the average Python user may find powerxrd to be more user-friendly than Origin for this type of analysis. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`installation` the project.
