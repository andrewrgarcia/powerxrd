[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/powerxrd.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/powerxrd/)

A Python package for parsing, visualizing, and analyzing powder XRD data – now at **v3.0.0**, and still somehow free.  
The only known open-source GitHub project with an in-progress Rietveld refinement method that isn’t locked in someone's grad school folder.
